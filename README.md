This application is a bus management system for the city of Vancouver.
Within the application you can choose between 3 features. Firstly, you can enter 1 to find the shortest path between 2 bus stops. This uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to give the shortest “cost” and the associated stops on the path to that stop. Next you can enter 2 to search for a bus stop. This takes in the full name or the first few letters of the bus stop to return all the matching cases. And finally you can enter 3 to search for all trips for a given arrival time, these will be sorted by TripID using merge sort. The user interface is over command line.
